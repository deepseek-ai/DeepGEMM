abstract: >-
  DeepGEMM is a library designed for clean and efficient
  General Matrix Multiplications (GEMMs). It supports FP8
  and BF16 for both normal and Mix-of-Experts (MoE) grouped
  scenarios. Written in CUDA, the library compiles all kernels
  at runtime using a lightweight Just-In-Time (JIT) module.
  Despite its lightweight design, DeepGEMM's performance
  matches or exceeds expert-tuned libraries across various
  matrix shapes.
